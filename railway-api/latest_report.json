But the last hardware refresh was in 2019, and today the device is finally starting to show its age.\n\nModern apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Plex have become heavier every year. Switching between apps is not as smooth as it used to be, multitasking is harder, and newer streaming standards are moving forward while the hardware stays the same. \n\nThe Shield was ahead of its time, but software has now caught up.\n\nWhat makes this harder to understand is where NVIDIA is today as a company. Your shares are hitting all-time highs, AI is booming, and NVIDIA is stronger financially than ever. Completely understandable that the focus is on AI right now, but it feels like one important product quietly got left behind along the way: the Shield.\n\nThe community never stopped caring about this device. People still trust it, still use it daily, and many of us would preorder a refreshed Shield instantly.\n\nWe are not asking for reinvention.\n\nJust a refresh: modern hardware, better performance headroom, and support for current streaming standards.\n\n*If anyone at NVIDIA reads this, please pass it along to the Shield team.*\n\nThe Shield does not need to end. It just needs its next chapter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA lot of Shield users still waiting.",

Bios switch is set to Silent by the way.\n\nHad some Arctic MX-6 thermal paste laying around and thought: let's do it. Replaced the paste on the GPU (left the stock pads as they still looked good and intact), and here is the result. Compared quick 'n dirty with Furmark, measured after 2 minutes of running.\n\nBefore: 77 C (104 C hotspot), fans at \\~3000 RPM\n\nAfter: 70 C (84 C hotspot), fans at \\~ 1670 RPM\n\nAfter letting it run for 15 minutes, it's still at roughly the same temps; the fan speed went up to \\~1840 RPM. Before replacing the thermal paste, the fans would probably ramp up to the turbo noise at this point.\n\nHappy with the result of this fix that was basically free and took like 15 minutes.\n\nEdit: before you try this at home, please also read this comment (and other comments) about the pads: https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/s/ReBo3aZnW2 \nYou might damage the pads by removing the cooler.

      "title": "DLSS 4.5 does NOT oversharpen",
      "text": "Before I start, I'm willing to see some opposing evidence here that I've yet to see, if you can show me ringing, haloing, crunchiness, artificial aging on characters, anything that is NOT there in previous models *or* in the native non anti-aliased image, by all means do so. Don't just compare Preset M to Preset K or other TAA models and show us that M is sharper because that tells us nothing, yes it is sharper, but so is the native image it's trying to replicate!\n\nI'm tired of everyone claiming Preset M/L are oversharpening everywhere with no evidence, especially at scaling factors higher than Performance mode. Improvements still scale all the way up. Now this is all at 4K, I haven't seen 1440p and I imagine it does look even more odd, but that's for someone else to decide.\n\nThese new models are bringing out and retaining true sub-pixel detail that is **already there** in the native, non anti-aliased image. Previous models, as well as every other temporal solution we've had in the past, have always favoured stability over detail, because it's safe and easier to do, this means they smooth over details to make sure there's no aliasing. Both have different issues (which is why it's subjective) but the new model does have real benefits.\n\nThe new models require more compute and more time, this gives them the ability to make even smarter, better decisions that allow more detail to be kept than ever before, while still having great temporal anti-aliasing. Many seem to think this only applies to Performance Mode and below just because Nvidia recommends it, even though they've clearly stated that quality improves at all scaling factors. The recommendation is due to performance concerns, which are valid, but that doesn't mean it goes downhill at Quality and DLAA, it still gets better.\n\n  \nThese comparisons are with in-game sharpening disabled (another thing causing such a big issue over this). These also might not seem like a big deal in this dark cave, but keep in mind that these tiny details apply everywhere, mostly to particles and edges but surface detail too.\n\n[Here is a comparison of 4K DLAA using Preset K, vs 4K with no anti-aliasing](https://imgsli.com/NDQ5NTQx). Look at how many of those particles are completely erased with Preset K **even at DLAA**. The algorithm treats them as \"aliasing\" because they're so tiny and they do shimmer in motion a lot, so it chooses to smooth them out so much that it essentially removes them. This also shows that even at this high resolution, DLAA Preset K is still flawed and has room for improvement in terms of detail.\n\n  \nSo now that we know those particles are supposed to be there, [Here is 4K DLAA Preset K again, but against the new Preset M.](https://imgsli.com/NDQ5NTQw) The new model clearly retains significantly more of them (but still loses some of the smallest ones), sharpening cannot bring out detail like that if it isn't already there. And the important thing is, **this scales and improves all the way up to DLAA** unlike some are claiming. DLSS Performance and lower lose more of them, and they shimmer far more in motion too, meaning the higher scaling modes do NOT just over sharpen, otherwise the shimmering would be significantly exacerbated, they wouldn't be *more* stable and more visible, that's not how it works. Side note: the slight lighting brightness difference on the bottom middle rocks is due to game lighting changing a bit, not the models, another screenshot had them look the same there.\n\n  \n[This one isn't even to compare anything in partcular](https://imgsli.com/NDQ5NTUx), but you people want to talk about sharp? Look at how ridiculously \"sharp\" the grass and trees in the no anti-aliasing image look. That's what these models are trying to be, except while being anti-aliased. The new model is much closer to that than the old ones, at every scale factor, yet is STILL softer even at DLAA.\n\nBefore this, I'd already looked at many other side by sides and saw no sharpening artifact issues or anything of the sort (if the game had none baked in), only an image that looked closer to the raw image than previous models, but apparently it's just \"placebo\" and maybe I need to get my eyes checked. I chose these to hopefully demonstrate it a bit better but who knows if it will.\n\nI've said it before but it LOOKS oversharpened because we have never seen a temporally stable image that has near the detail of the non anti-aliased image, not to mention the majority of people haven't seen what a raw image looks like in many, many years, if ever. We get closer to it with every new model, but this has been one of the bigger leaps and now people are screaming \"oversharpened\". If you like a softer image, use the softer model, but don't claim things that aren't true because you don't like it. It's taken me some time to get used to it too.\n\nAlex from DF said it well \"one isn't objectively better than the other necessarily always in terms of sharpness. It doesn't mean it's better or worse\". I already know there will be people that still refuse to think this is anything but oversharpening, and they're welcome to, but at the end of the day, you'll be the ones losing out on all that sweet detail that you claim is fake, when it clearly isn't.",

It\u2019s quite impressive that I can run the game on Ultra settings at 1080p while consuming only 100\u2013130W. However, I prefer playing on the Original settings, where it only uses around 70\u201385W, which is still impressive\u2014especially compared to a stock Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 that can draw 150W or more on Ultra settings.\n\nI\u2019ve added +1000MHz to the memory clock. So far, everything seems stable, and my temperatures are only around 40\u201343\u00b0C, which is very cool for demanding graphics games. No crashes so far, which might also be thanks to my MSI Gaming RTX 5070 12G Shadow 2X OC. Overclocking isn\u2019t really my main goal\u2014I want to reduce power consumption as much as possible without sacrificing good graphics quality.\n\nI\u2019m also following the settings from this [video](https://youtu.be/MhnVyMry9BU?si=DIlOospAhaTNfrmL&amp;t=321) (875mV targeting 2600MHz), which might be the most efficient. Still, I want to try even lower power consumption since it\u2019s safer (ofc than OC) and could improve the longevity of the card. I\u2019ve also set up an OC-UV profile that I can use when needed for work and editing.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone else has interesting experiences with OC/UV on the RTX 5070?",

      "text": "I did a LOT of testing (mostly in RDR2) on my RTX 4060 and found a method that improves image quality for all the modern games I played so far.\n\nIf you play on a 1080p screen you can combine DLSS and DL-DSR (2.25x) to remove blur and drastically improve your image quality, while not losing too much performance. I get at least 60fps in all games (that I played so far).\n\nThe problem with 1080p in modern games isn't the screen resolution itself. It's the game engines that just look bad at that resolution. Especially RDR2.\n\nWith DL-DSR you can run the game at a higher internal resolution. The AI renders it back down to your screens 1080p preserving much more detail than native 1080p. That of course eats lots of performance. Here's the trick I found:\n\nSomehow that gain in image quality is preserved even when combined with DLSS (which practically lowers the internal resolution to even lower than 1080p). This likely means that, when using both, the added detail is mainly created by the AI upscaling. But honestly it definitely looks much better than native 1080p to me.\n\nI have also compared it to native 1080p and DLAA but found that it lacks detail in comparison. I theorize that it's because DLAA only fixes the TAA blur - while upscaling to 1620p (if you use 2.25x) gives the AI upscaler room to do its \"magic\" and add in more detail.\n\nTL;DR from what I found, using DLSS to upscale from less than 1080p to 1620p results in a better image than native 1080p. Even after the 1620p image is sampled back down to 1080p by DL-DSR.\n\nI hope this helps and would like to hear others thoughts about this :)\n\n(edit:)  \n**HOW-TO:**  \nIn your Nvidia Control Panel go to Manage 3D Settings &gt; Global Settings. Look for DSR - Factors in the list and enable the newer DL-DSR options (they are at the top of the checklist).\n\nI recommend 2.25x (which gives you 1620p), but 1.78x works too. After that you can set your games to higher resolutions like 2880x1620p in the ingame settings.\n\nThen just combine it with DLSS, i use balanced.",

Also push for high megapixels over quality misled the direction which smartphone camera could have taken. Professional &amp; wildlife photography still do not push sensors beyond 50 MP, which is important since it gives best balance of resolution without compromising quality otherwise the hardware must become very bulky, and some players like Samsung refuse to accept that anything above 50 MP has proved to be waste of engineering resources, money &amp; time. Both for company &amp; users. And to further add to problem, companies are continuing to refuse\n\n* add the older flagship cameras to mid &amp; low end smartphones, use bulk cheap benefit.\n* increase sensor size for mid range in 50 MP, so pixels go above 0.8 micrometer.\n* discontinue 100 MP in low end with tiny 0.64 micrometer pixels, which serves marketing but does nothing to the quality compared to 50 MP.",

Sometimes it took 5 minutes and sometimes it took 30 minutes to crash. All 3 monitors go black and say no signal and the audio cuts out. I have to manually restart the pc via the reset button.

      "text": "Hey everyone, I am looking to build a new pc after a long time of being out of the hardware market and the research is kind of overwhelming me right now.\n\nThis is what I am planning to buy right now:\n\n| Component | Choice |\n| --- | --- |\n| CPU | AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D |\n| Cooler | be quiet! Light Loop 360mm AIO |\n| Mainboard | Gigabyte B850 AORUS Stealth |\n| GPU | XFX Radeon RX 9070 XT Mercury |\n| SSD | 2 TB Samsung 990 PRO M.2 |\n| RAM | 32 GB DDR 5 6000 MHz Kingston Fury Beast RGB |\n| PSU | 1000 Watt be quiet! Straight Power 12 |\n\nThe main question I have is about the CPU choice. Is it the right choice over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D? Everywhere I look I see that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the Ryzen 9 9950X3D are pretty much equal on benchmarks.  \nThe main focus of this PC will be gaming, but I also do enjoy programming a lot which comes with needing to compile stuff frequently. Also I mainly play games that are CPU limited, I mostly play Path of Exile 1 right now.  \nWhat may also be important is that I am using Linux (That is also why I chose the AMD graphics card). I think the Proton overhead could play a factor in games being more CPU-heavy?\n\nNext question I have is about the Mainboard. I already have a nice PC case with back-connector support so I wanted to take advantage of it, but there aren't that many out there. Is the B850 chipset alright or should I go with a mainboard with the X870 chipset?\n\nAlso I am considering going with 64GB of RAM since I am spending a lot anyways. Prices don't seem like they will be going up soon but I feel bad overspending so much. Is 64GB worth it?\n\nLastly do can I go with an 850W PSU or is it 1000W? The calculators I found were putting me right on the edge of 850W and I guess I would rather be on the safe side.\n\nI would love to hear your opinions on these questions and also generally on this build.

I am a noob to PC building and was looking for this route but felt overwhelmed as I don't know much as my old PC was prebuilt. I started looking into prebuilts again and found Legion Tower 7i Gen 10 (Intel) with RTX\u2122 5070 Ti on their official website for $2199.99.  Also I would probably want to add more space to this as it is only 1TB so I would probably be spending potentially $500 more bringing the total to around 2699.99 on this Prebuilt PC if google ai is showing accurate prices for good 2TB SSDs (I used the high end price suggested btw).\n\nI am looking to play Call of Duty and other shooters at 4K along and use ray tracing for Minecraft. I play lots of different types of games but these are games I play the most. I also want at least 4TB of space. I already have a good monitor, gaming keyboard, and gaming mouse.\n\nMy question is this which relates to this subreddit. Can I build from scratch a 4K gaming PC with at least 4TB of space for a better price than this? I tried messing around with pcpartpicker but had no idea where to start and what parts were worth it. I am wanting to research both options of prebuilt vs building a PC but without me knowing what is a good custom PC build for my needs makes it really hard for me to know if I am getting the best for the money I am spending.\n\n  \nAdding the specs as suggested by comments\n\n* Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra 9 285K Processor (E-cores up to 4.60 GHz P-cores up to 5.50 GHz)\n* Windows 11 Home 64\n* NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce RTX\u2122 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7\n* 32 GB DDR5-5600MT/s (UDIMM)(2 x 16 GB)\n* 1 TB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 TLC\n* 850W\n* 250W 360mm Liquid Cooling + 1 x Rear + 2 x Top with ARGB Fan",

I wanted to play NV for the first time, and got myself this modlist with wabbajack and followed the guide, I did everything correctly and also used the decompressor. When I use the Launcher it sets my preset on Ultra, and when I a year ago already just shortly played NV and where I got a couple mods only it ran perfectly really with no performance issues or low fps. Now with Viva modlist I get 10 fps outside, and 60 to like 50-40 fps inside. \n\nPeople say that this modlist is really just fixing performance issues and even better running than the vanilla game but that is not the case for me at all and it seems like this mod does have some shader I guess or simply some higher demanding mod and it looks great. \n\nTo my specs I do unfortunately have a pretty low spec laptop, and I'm working on getting a PC finally, but for now here are my specs, hope you can just tell me if I'd just give up and play this right in a couple years maybe or if somethings weird because even on Skyrim and the modlist gates to sovengarde that has multiple shaders I still even on high settings have like 30fps outside.\n\nIntel Core i5-10300 cpu 2.50 ghz, NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650 Ti, 8gb RAM\n\nI know that is very low, but it still should be perfectly fine to play something like New Vegas and even with some mods especially this modlist, and I'm playing games like RDR2 just fine.",

Apostou na altura cerca de 1.3B contra o mercado imobili\u00e1rio ao ter detetado que existia um excesso de investimento numa bolha que n\u00e3o tinha valor real.\n\nEm 2025, fez o mesmo com a $NVDA e a $PLTR, e tem sido bastante vocal no Twitter/X acerca dessas decis\u00f5es controversas - ao ponto de levar a NVIDIA a formalizar uma resposta dirigida aos seus investidores.\n\n[Hero section do projecto.

      "text": "\n\nLet\u2019s be real for a second. If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019ve probably spent the last three Saturday afternoons staring at a spinning blue circle while your group chat explodes because someone just scored.\n\nI\u2019ve been down the rabbit hole. I\u2019ve wasted money on \"50,000 Channel\" packages that cost \u00a35 and disappear after a month. I\u2019ve dealt with the \"Indian Tech Support\" that tells you to restart your router when the problem is clearly their overloaded server.\n\nAfter six months of testing\u2014specifically focusing on [**British channels and sports**](http://one4k.co.uk)\u2014I\u2019ve finally found a setup that actually works. This isn't a paid ad; it's the post I wish I\u2019d found a year ago.\n\n# The Problem: Why \"Cheap\" IPTV Always Fails in the UK\n\nThe UK is a unique beast. Our ISPs (Virgin, Sky, BT) are aggressive. They don't just block sites; they \"throttle\" traffic during Premier League games or F1 races. If your provider uses a cheap, oversold server, it *will* choke the moment the whistle blows.\n\n# The Service: Redfoox &amp; one4K (The Current Frontrunners)\n\nI\u2019ve narrowed my \"daily drivers\" down to two. I\u2019m currently using [**one4K.co.uk**](http://one4K.co.uk) as my primary and Redfoox as a backup.\n\n* **The \"Anti-Freeze\" Reality:** Does \"Zero Buffering\" exist? No. If a provider says that, they\u2019re lying. But with these, I\u2019ve had maybe *one* 2-second stutter in a 90-minute match. That is the gold standard.\n* **The Quality:** Most \"4K\" streams are just upscaled 720p. These guys actually push high-bitrate 50fps streams. If you\u2019re watching Sky Sports Main Event, you want the grass to look like grass, not green soup.\n* **The EPG (Electronic Program Guide):** This is the unsung hero. Nothing is worse than a guide that says \"No Information.\" Having a fully synced UK guide that matches London time is a luxury you didn't know you needed.\n\n# The \"No-Buffer\" Tech Stack (Crucial) \n\n1. **The Hardware:** **Nvidia Shield TV Pro** or **Firestick 4K Max (Gen 2)** or **SmartTV.**\n2. **The App:** **8k vip player** or **TiviMate Premium** or **ibo pro player** \n3. **The Connection:** If you can, **hardwire via Ethernet**.\n\n# My Honest Verdict\n\nIf you\u2019re tired of the \"trial and error\" loop, stop looking for the cheapest price. You get what you pay for. For about the price of two pints a month, you can get a service that actually works when the game is on.\n\n# The Pros:\n\n* Actually stable during 3 PM kickoffs.\n* EPG that works 99% of the time.\n* VOD library that basically replaces Netflix/Disney+.\n\n# The Cons:\n\nThe channel lists are huge; you\u2019ll spend your first hour just setting up \"Favorites.\"",

      "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s be real: searching for the \u201cbest IPTV\u201d 2026 is currently a nightmare. Every thread is 90% bots or \"DM me\" scammers.\n\nI got tired of my screen freezing right as the kicker lined up for a field goal, so I decided to go on a 6-month binge-testing spree. I ran these services on a Firestick 4K Max and an Nvidia Shield Pro, focusing on how they actually hold up during the \"Saturday night crunch\" when servers usually melt.\n\nHere is the honest, technical hierarchy of what\u2019s left standing.\n\n\\---\n\n\\### 1. The Undisputed 2026 King: Smartiflix\n\nIf you want the closest thing to a \"legit\" cable experience that your family won't complain about, this is it. Smartiflix is the heavyweight champion for a reason\u2014it simply doesn't break when the world is watching.\n\n\\* The \"Anti-Freeze\" Factor: They are using Anti-Freeze\u2122 9.8 tech. In plain English: while other servers loop or crash during the Super Bowl or Premier League, Smartiflix load-balances perfectly.\n\n\\* The Data: A massive 61,000+ Live Channels. The \"zapping\" (channel switching) is almost instant\u2014I clocked it at under 0.8 seconds.\n\n\\* Why it wins: It has the lowest latency I\u2019ve seen in 2026. You won't hear your neighbor cheer a goal 30 seconds before you see it. It is the best all-around service for the USA, Canada, and Worldwide.\n\n\\### 2. The European Specialist: Zyminex\n\nIf you are based in the EU or need deep-cut local affiliates, Zyminex is the top alternative.\n\n\\* The Tech: They use a proprietary infrastructure optimized for EU nodes, making it incredibly stable for French, German, and Italian local channels.\n\n\\* Verdict: The best choice if your primary focus is European regional stability and lag-free local matches.\n\n\\### 3. The VOD &amp; EPG Powerhouses: Trimixtriangles &amp; Tiviport\n\n\\* Trimixtriangles: The \"Netflix-Killer.\" If you want to cancel every streaming sub, this is the move. Over 180,000 Movies &amp; Series in high-bitrate HEVC (H.265). The picture quality on an OLED is noticeably better than the compressed garbage others sell.\n\n\\* Tiviport: The king of the EPG (TV Guide). 95% of the guide is actually populated. No more \"No Information\" bars cluttering your TiviMate.\n\n\\---\n\n\\### Other Alternatives Worth Mentioning\n\nI also ran these through the ringer; they\u2019re solid depending on your specific needs:\n\n\\* Mekoflix: Parallel to Zyminex for niche European regional channels.\n\n\\* Nigma TV &amp; Xtreme HD: Great if you need multi-device stability (running 3+ TVs simultaneously).\n\n\\* IPTGreat &amp; Smartsgi: Solid budget picks if you just want live TV and don't care about a massive VOD library.\n\n\\* Marinions: Shout out to their support. They actually respond on WhatsApp in like 10 minutes\u2014perfect for beginners.\n\n\\---\n\n\\### My \"Best IPTV\" Pro-Setup Tips\n\nEven the best provider will buffer if your setup is weak. Here is the 2026 pro-list:\n\n1. Stop using Smart TV apps. The CPUs are too weak to load a 180k VOD library. Buy a Firestick 4K Max or Nvidia Shield.\n\n2. Hardwire Everything. WiFi \"jitter\" is the #1 cause of micro-buffering. Use an Ethernet cable.\n\n3. Use TiviMate (Premium). It is the gold standard. Use Xtream Codes login\u2014it\u2019s 5x faster than M3U links.\n\n4. VPN: Always use one (Nord/Surfshark) to prevent ISP throttling during big games.\n\nConclusion: If you\u2019re done with the $5 trials that ghost you, go Smartiflix. If you need the best European local stability, go Zyminex. For a perfect VOD experience, go Trimixtriangles.",

      "text": "**Hello fellow people frm GOG community**\ud83d\udc9b\n\nHope ur having a great day \ud83d\ude00. A few days ago I posted a request asking for cyberpunk 2077. After posting i was just scrolling through this sub reddit &amp; I hovered upon a post in which smone mentioned that \"most people in this community who request games are just after the hype/they don't try much hard to express their want for games in their requests...etc\".After reading that I went back reading my post &amp; realized that it was horrible. To be frank at first I thought i just gotta keep my request short then realized that if I was in this situation irl , I would've delivered a whole speech on why I want this game . So in this 2nd attempt im gonna redeem myself on how badly I want this game. So guys be prepared for this long journey \n\n**About Myself**\ud83d\udc9b\n\nFirst of all lemme introduce myself. I am a lad who turned 18 this month residing in a 3rd world country.I started to gain interest in games since my teenage years. At those times mostly I played mobile games like subway surfers, temple run, robbery Bob, coc,\nDr.driving and various other popular games. After that I slowly got introduced on using emulators in my phone like PSP, N64, Gameboy, Citrus, where I played old games like Lego island 1 , Mario, Fifa, God of war, Gta Chinatown &amp; Liberty city, Gran turismo , NFS most wanted, Pok\u00e9mon, Lego games and many many more games.....that was the time when I slowly gained interest in PC gaming. At that time I had a laptop with a 820M graphics card(low end) in which I had played some GTA games, Nfs games,Assassin's creed games and many more.....Then came the covid period where everything was through online that's when I really got interest in PC gaming,I would always try to find mobile ports of PC games which where trending like hollow knight and many indie games.....then I found out about a cloud gaming platform known as GEForce Now by Nvidia, ASAP I registered &amp; allotted a free subscription . At that i got to know about epic games and their free game drops...frm them i got many games like tomb raider series, control, amnesia, and numerous other games. Mostly i used ge force now on my mobile than my laptop and the experience was awesome. Me and my brother would be playing for hours even when there were online classes going on  .After a while I started my Steam account &amp; played some of their free games. I have awesome parents and mostly they encourage us to study than playing games, also they won't let me spend money for buying games and all....In the year 2025 I got an idea of buying games without my parents noticing. So I started to save money I get as allowances like for traveling,  food , etc and I would give it to my frnd in order to buy me steam gift cards  so that I could buy games when they're on sale and I've bought sm games. My gaming genre is basically rpg, open world, adventure, survival, story telling , &amp; PVP games. I always watched youtubers playing my fav games &amp; I loved it. Last month I got a 14 day trial xbox premium pass where I tried many games but also played GTA 5 for the first time &amp; I completd 60% of the game ,mostly I just explored it and it was fun...That's all abt me &amp; let's move to the next chapter\n\n**Why do i want Cyberpunk 2077**\ud83d\udc9b\n\nI am a great fan of rpg &amp; open world adventure type games and I love playing them. I've been a great supporter of CDPR for their Witcher series &amp; I've completed them all using cracked versions and I've never regretted playing their games. I gotta know abt cyberpunk when they 1st  released the game and everyone pointed out various glitches and bugs , I thought that CDPR was cooked &amp; didn't expected their game to be a disaster where everyone got refunds for purchasing their game ,  but they didn't backed down on us and brought it back to life. Since the release I've watched many gameplay videos and shorts about 2077 and I loved it. To be frank at 1st I thought that this futuristic 1st person game is not gonna be fun to play (i mostly played 3rd person games ). Then I got to know abt their anime which brought me to tears(they did David dirty in the end) After this i slowly started to develop love for this game\n\nI liked watching ganeplay videos abt it &amp; it felt like this might be like living in the future (like the ones we saw in 2016 YouTube where there would be some futuristic world where we could use flying cars &amp; sm crazy things). It really felt like a depressed dude living in a futuristic world where I had free will like I could feel like iam the MC , where taking late night rides through the night city in a bike/car blasting music  , taking late night showers, riding the metro feeling like a corporate man going to work .  This game has so many new features &amp; I absolutely love it. Really loved the futuristic cars and bikes especially the bike which looks like the one frm the anime movie \"AKIRA\". There's loads of things I need to say but it won't fit here.....\n\nIf I get this game I can't even think abt what all things I would do,the bucket list too looonnnggg.....\n\n1)I would play every single mode frm normal to corporate.\n\n2)Play my 1st playthrough with Male V then Female V\n\n3)Explore the vast open world\n\n4)Complete all side quests\n\n5)Give GTA treatment to NPC'S \n\n6)Live like a thug &amp; a millionaire\n\n7)Battle MaxTac\n\n8)Create a perfect build for combat\n\n9)Take pictures throughout the game\n\n10)Take a late night shower and then a long nap\n\n11)Take a late night bike ride\n\n12)Take implants\n\n13)Look at the moon\n\n14)Decipher every secrets in the game\n\n15)Play multiple playthorughs and 100% the game\n\n16)Visit main locations from the anime\n\n17)Obliterate Adam Smasher  (revenge for David &amp; Rebecca)\n\n18)Drive the whole city in Vista Porsche 911\n\n19)Fully mod the game \n\n20)Meet Johnny Silverhand\n\n21)Experience multiple endings\n\n22)Test the multi-player mod(wish they released multi-player feature                       so gotta use mods)\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n.........................................AND MANY MORE.......................................\n\n**FAQ about CYBERPUNK 2077**\ud83d\udc9b\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is an open-world action RPG set in Night City, a neon-drenched megalopolis where power, corporate greed, and body modification define daily life. You play as V, a mercenary-for-hire caught in a high-stakes struggle for survival after a botched heist. Following the job, you find yourself sharing your mind with the digital ghost of Johnny Silverhand, a legendary rocker and anti-corporate rebel. As his personality begins to merge with yours, you must navigate the city\u2019s dangerous underworld to find a way to secure your future. \n\n\u200bThe game offers deep character customization through its \"Ripperdoc\" system, allowing you to install cybernetic implants that fundamentally change how you play. You can choose to be a Netrunner who hacks into enemy systems and neural links, a high-mobility Shinobi using blades and \"Sandevistan\" reflex boosters to slow down time, or a heavy-hitting Solo who relies on raw strength and massive firepower. The world is highly reactive, with your choices in dialogue and mission approaches influencing your reputation and the way the story unfolds.\n\n**Conclusion**\ud83d\udc9b\n\nThis is all I gotta say &amp; for me this game has a special place in my heart its a 10/10 for me. I am requesting this game here because I can't afford to pay for AAA games as a student . I would be very much delighted if someone gifts me this game \u2764\ufe0f. Thank u for reading this(it took me a long enough to write this ).I hope u guys have a wonderful day\ud83e\udd0d\n\nHere's the link to the game:https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/\n\nHere's the link to my profile:https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199224894563/\n\n\n                      \ud83d\udc9b***I hope someone helps out a Choom***\ud83d\udc9b\n",

      "text": "Hey guys! Just bought this build with a 5090 and a 9950X3D. I currently have a LG GX700a 1440p monitor, but it is still within its return period. Everyone is saying I should be doing 4K with this setup. I play a variety of games. Competitive FPS and AAA single player titles. I want to be able to play my games at ultra quality with full RT. I\u2019m not opposed to using DLSS, but I do not want to use frame gen. From what I can tell looking at benchmarks, my FPS is going to be so much better at 1440p even if I\u2019m CPU limited on some titles. I understand the card is meant for 4K, but I\u2019d like the opinion of people who play a large variety of games like I do. I want a smooth high FPS ultra quality experience. Looking into it, I feel dumb because I know it\u2019s an expensive card, but I plan to have this system for at least 8 years and I know the term \u201cfuture proof\u201d is frowned upon. I\u2019m also aware that this system is overkill. I got a good work bonus and decided to buy the best system I could. Just looking for some thoughts here. I appreciate it!",

That said, I'm wondering if there's a general rule of thumb here that applies to what is a good investment vs what isn't.\n\nFor instance: I'm sure I'll see pretty big generation times and more permissive, larger image/video size gains by going to, say, a 5090 over a 4090, but for just \"little\" bit more, is going to a 48GB Blackwell Pro 5000 worth it? I seem to recall some threads around here saying that certain Blackwell Pro cards perform worse than a 5090 for this kind of use case? \n\nI really want to treat this as a buy once, cry once scenario but I'm not sure what makes more sense, or if there's any downside to just adding in a Blackwell Pro card (either 32GB, which, again, anecdotally I have heard perform worse than a 5090. I believe it has something to do with total power draw, CUDA cores, and clock speeds, if I'm not mistaken? Any advice here is most welcome!",

So I reused some of the old parts and 2000 USD later I have a way more powerful machine. I don\u2019t really need a machine to go to Starbucks to play 3A games.

I wanted something more like the Winter One design, all in one clean piece, so I tried to model it myself. Well\u2026 I gave up.\n\nSince I had been hunting deals for two years and didn\u2019t want to spend two more years learning CAD, I bought a Lian Li Air Mini instead.\n\nI started the build and quickly realized that hardline tubing as a first-timer is hard. So I bought soft tubing for now. I might try hardline again when I swap parts or need to drain the loop.\n\nSoft tubing looks a bit chaotic since I wanted to show the FLT80, but I\u2019m happy that it works at least.\n\nParts and prices (for budget hunters maybe):\n\nUsed parts:\n\n\u2022 280x30 Corsair Neo \u2013 20\u20ac\n\n\u2022 280x20 HPE Alphacool \u2013 45\u20ac\n\n\u2022 240x30 HPE Alphacool \u2013 20\u20ac\n\n\u2022 Heatkiller Pro V Waterblock \u2013 40\u20ac with surprise Ultra Backplate\n\n\u2022 Lian Li Air Mini \u2013 57\u20ac\n\n\u2022 D5 Pump Corsair with reservoir \u2013 30\u20ac\n\n\u2022 FLT80 Pump reservoir without pump \u2013 40\u20ac\n\n\u2022 Commander Pro Corsair \u2013 10\u20ac\n\nExtremely lucky with the prices \ud83d\ude42\n\nNew parts:\n\n\u2022 Apex CPU Block \u2013 90\u20ac\n\n\u2022 Fittings, coolant, tubes, fans, plugs, etc. \u2013 \\~250\u20ac\n\nSpecs:\n\n9800X3D\n\n4090 FE\n\nArctic P14 Pro and P12 Pro fans\n\n1000W Corsair SFX PSU\n\nMSI B650I Edge WiFi\n\n2TB Crucial P3 Plus and 2TB P3\n\nTemps:\n\nSilent mode (room 20\u00b0C)\n\nFans @ 600 RPM / D5 @ 2000 RPM\n\n4090 with 450W max in FurMark:\n\n\u2192 GPU 55\u00b0C, hotspot 61\u00b0C, VRM 51\u00b0C\n\n\u2192 Water 38\u201340\u00b0C\n\nI can\u2019t hear anything and I\u2019m happy with the temps, even with slightly warm water.

(better TGS than the Spark, worse prefill (but probably better prefill than the Halo ?!) \\~$4k+\n\nAnd then you have \n\n5090 or 4090 (24 GBs) with Ktransformers (active MoEs in the VRAM while the rest in system RAM and they offload and load quickly between VRAM and RAM) \n\nWould that be the best option ?! \n\nA single GPU alone is around \\~$2k, not to mention the RAM, processor and rest of hardware, and also this consumes more watts \n\nOr 2x5090 or 4090 plus the same RAM setup (GPUs alone are \\~$4k+)\n\nCost wise the GPUs alone would cost as much as one or two DGX Spark or a Mac Studio \n\nThis opens up the door to cluster two Halos, or two sparks \n\nThis can give you 50% increase but very experimental setup at the cost of \\~$4k\n\nOr cluster two sparks (around 50% increase in performance also give or take for \\~$8k+) \n\nOr cluster two max studios ?! (Idk about that or maybe just a bigger RAM Mac but even then you won\u2019t get much of a massive improvement!) \n\nIt seems like one AI mini pc is good, DGX Spark maybe is the best prefill wise, for Mac\u2019s if you don\u2019t need it for things other than AI, going beyond the 128GB won\u2019t be much of an upgrade \n\nAnd ofc a 2x5090 setup with 200GB+ RAM is probably the best solution (excluding some additional RAM and hardware costs! And electricity costs!) \n\nThis way you can run some of the best models at Q8 or Q4 in a decent performance\n\nBut it feels so hacky, maybe then go with enterprise grade GPUs (but then diminishing returns starts to steep!) \n\nNot much options tbh and it feels like the early day of PCs and Altair and Apple \\]\\[ and stuff \n\nWhy is that \n\nCan we fast forward 10 20 or even 30 days later when there\u2019s stuff becomes off the shelf commodities ?! \n\n(I mean Moores law is ending but still we can just create RAM with built in small ALUs at each cell for Mat-Mul, can\u2019t we ?!)

      "text": "Howdy! A few weeks ago I launched vm-curator as a FOSS hobby project. Since then, the project has matured substantially, solving real-world problems with Linux desktop&#x2F;workstation VM management. Presenting, now, the official &quot;grand-opening&quot; release.<p>vm-curator is a rust TUI that works directly with QEMU&#x2F;KVM, skipping libvirt. It is designed for desktop use-cases. (For servers, Proxmox is a better choice.) QEMU runs in user (non-root) mode only.<p>The app&#x27;s biggest feature is guided support for single and multi-gpu passthrough. For computers with only one GPU, vm-curator will write and manage scripts to detach your GPU from your Linux display manager, attach it to your VM, and then will monitor your VM&#x27;s use so that upon shutdown, it will reverse the attachment and restore your Linux display. For computers with multiple GPUs, vm-curator provides easy configuration of GPU-passthrough with support for looking glass. vm-curator also supports virgl para-virtualized 3D acceleration, which works great in Linux guests (but for full GPU performance, pass-through is a must.)<p>vm-curator also supports SLIRP, passt, and bridged mode for networking back-ends, comprehensive USB and PCI detection and pass-through, VM state monitoring, QCOWS2 snapshot management, and host directory passthrough. For BTRFS users, vm-curator will also automatically turn off BTRFS copy-on-write for your VM directory to avoid the double copy-on-write performance penalty. VM installation is easy with over 120 OS profiles built-in.<p>I&#x27;ve long wanted to leverage QEMU&#x2F;KVM for desktop virtualization, but have been long stymied by gnome boxes (lacks advanced features) and virt-manager (very difficult to setup, especially with NVIDIA GPUs.) vm-curator has solved these hurdles for me. Hopefully it can help you as well.<p>FOSS engagement (PRs&#x2F;contributions + feedback) is most welcome!",

If you&#x27;ve ever shared a multi-GPU machine with teammates and dealt\n   with GPU conflicts, or just wanted a simple way to queue up training jobs overnight, this is for that.\n\n  The problem: SLURM is designed for clusters. Setting it up on a single machine is overkill, and most ML teams sharing a workstation end up with ad-hoc\n  solutions \u2014 checking nvidia-smi, shouting in Slack, or writing hacky bash scripts.\n\n  gflow gives you:\n\n  - Job queue with GPU-aware scheduling \u2014 auto-detects GPUs via NVML, handles allocation and sets CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for you\n  - Job dependencies \u2014 with AND&#x2F;OR logic, so you can chain training \u2192 eval \u2192 export\n  - Job arrays \u2014 for hyperparameter sweeps\n  - tmux-based execution \u2014 jobs run in tmux sessions, so you can attach to see live output, and they survive terminal disconnects\n  - Conda environment support \u2014 specify the env per job\n  - Webhook notifications \u2014 get pinged when jobs finish or fail\n  - SLURM-inspired CLI \u2014 gbatch, gqueue, gcancel, gjob \u2014 familiar if you&#x27;ve used SLURM, simpler if you haven&#x27;t\n\n  It&#x27;s a single Rust binary. Install via pip install runqd (pre-built binaries), cargo install, or grab a release from GitHub. Run gflowd init to set up,\n  gflowd up to start, and you&#x27;re scheduling jobs.\n\n  Example:\n  gbatch --gpus 2 --conda myenv python train.py --lr 0.001\n  gqueue\n  gjob log 1\n\n  Tech stack: Rust, Tokio, Axum (REST API), NVML, MessagePack for state persistence.\n\n  GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AndPuQing&#x2F;gflow\n\n  Happy to answer any questions.</code></pre>",

Is this a PDF, yes, but it harnesses my systems analysis experience to help hard-code a framework for a person off the street to turn their AI chat box into an objective decision-helper in just 15 to 20 minutes of use.<p>I spent 10+ years applying decision science in defense and systems analysis\u2014graduate work at Naval Postgraduate School, leading teams through decisions where the cost of choosing wrong wasn&#x27;t just money; it was mission failure or lives at risk.<p>The method used uses multi-attribute utility theory: define hard constraints (binary gates), eliminate non-viable options, score remaining candidates on mission-critical attributes with explicit weights, then run sensitivity analysis to see what changes the outcome.<p>I use this myself all the time.  The most recent was trying to upgrade my own laptop (Surface Pro stuck at Windows 10).<p>BLUF benefits:<p>\u2022 Helps prevent over-obsessing over specs (32GB RAM! RTX 4080!) while ignoring mission fit (do I really game that often?)<p>\u2022 Fleshes out hard constraints that sometimes come up until after purchase (bought Windows laptop, needs a way to support a MacOS app)<p>\u2022 Future-proofing: ensuring I won\u2019t pay feature I&#x27;ll statistically never use<p>\u2022 Aims to parse through the noise (SEO type posts) and get you a great first-pass research report of what you should value and why.<p>Consumer purchases don&#x27;t need full enterprise rigor, but they deserve better than &quot;Top 10 Laptops 2026&quot; affiliate listicles or chatbots hallucinating specs.<p>How the framework works:\n1. Mission definition: What must work reliably? (Video editing vs office work vs travel)<p>2. Hard constraints: Binary gates (budget ceiling, OS requirements, battery minimums)<p>3. Candidate generation: AI searches current market without SEO or affiliate bias<p>4. Weighted scoring: Performance, battery, reliability, portability\u2014you control the weights<p>5. Efficient frontier: Which options dominate? Which are just expensive?<p>6. Sensitivity analysis: &quot;If battery life matters 25% instead of 15%, MacBook Air wins. If reliability matters more, ThinkPad wins.&quot;<p>The PDFs include example case studies I\u2019ve developed: policy analyst choosing ThinkPad X1 Carbon over MacBook Air (why reliability and docking beat battery life for enterprise work), freelance designer choosing Figma over Affinity Designer (why collaboration features justified 6x higher cost), consultant choosing Obsidian over Notion (why offline-first beat ease-of-use).<p>No barriers: No sign-up. No account. You get a PDF with prompts and case studies. Open ChatGPT or Claude (free version works), paste the prompt, answer questions. That&#x27;s it.<p>I built this because I was tired of seeing people (and myself) wasting money on impressive-sounding specs that don&#x27;t match their actual workflow. If you&#x27;ve ever regretted a tech purchase 3 weeks later, this might help.<p>Try it (I&#x27;d offer it free but then I loose my IP):\n\u2022 Tech &amp; Electronics: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decisioncontrolworks.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;auzhsa\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decisioncontrolworks.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;auzhsa</a>\n\u2022 Software &amp; Subscriptions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decisioncontrolworks.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;zaucxt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decisioncontrolworks.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;zaucxt</a><p>Curious what HN thinks\u2014especially if anyone&#x27;s tried applying formal decision methods to everyday purchases.",

I wanted to move beyond simple &quot;Hello World&quot; projects and tackle something that involved real-world constraints: network latency, data poisoning, and the &quot;Slow Peer Problem.&quot;<p>Key Technical Challenges I Solved:<p>Non-Blocking Concurrency: Used a worker pool where each peer gets its own Goroutine. I implemented a &quot;Stateless Worker&quot; logic where if a peer fails a SHA-1 hash check or drops the connection, the piece is automatically re-queued into a thread-safe channel for other peers to pick up.<p>Request Pipelining: To fight network RTT, I implemented a pipeline depth of 5. The client dispatches multiple 16KB block requests without waiting for the previous one to return, ensuring the bandwidth is fully saturated.<p>The Binary Boundary: Dealing with Big-Endian logic and the 68-byte binary handshake taught me more about encoding&#x2F;binary and byte-alignment than any textbook could.<p>Zero-Trust Data Integrity: Every 256KB piece is verified against a &quot;Golden Hash&quot; using crypto&#x2F;sha1 before being written to disk.

      "text": "This month is the 25th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto. I&#x27;ve been building banking systems for 25 years, which means I watched the entire arc from the beginning. Wanted to get HN&#x27;s take on something I noticed today.<p>My LinkedIn feed was flooded with anniversary posts from people who built the Agile industry \u2014 co-founders of the Scrum Alliance, the CEO of PMI, certified coaches, SAFe practitioners. The pattern across almost every post was striking: they acknowledge what went wrong, then continue doing the thing they just criticized.\nDirect quotes from today&#x27;s posts by certified Agile professionals:<p>&quot;We turned agile into a certification ladder&quot;\n&quot;Ceremony without intent&quot;\n&quot;Packaged mediocrity&quot;\nOne person called it &quot;the unforgivable sin: taking a manifesto that is 68 words long and turning it into a multibillion-dollar certification industry&quot;<p>These aren&#x27;t critics. These are people with CSM, SAFe SPC, PMP, and RTE after their names. They sell certifications and coaching for a living. The self-awareness is there. The business model hasn&#x27;t changed.\nSome numbers that stood out to me:<p>The original manifesto: 68 words, 4 values\nScrum Alliance certifications issued: 1.4 million+\nAverage CSM certification cost: ~$1,000\nSAFe full framework documentation: 800+ pages\nPMI stat shared today: 85% of executives say agility is critical, only 32% satisfied with implementation<p>That last one is interesting. A 53-point gap between &quot;we need this&quot; and &quot;this works.&quot; PMI&#x27;s response: they&#x27;re releasing a new Manifesto for Enterprise Agility on March 3rd. More framework to solve a framework problem.\nThe CEO of PMI actually replied to a comment I left questioning this approach. His response was that the new manifesto &quot;is NOT about software development&quot; \u2014 even though his own post opened by celebrating the Agile Software Development manifesto.\nIn fairness, some counter-arguments I want to acknowledge:<p>Agile genuinely helped some organizations move away from rigid waterfall. The pre-Agile world was often worse. The comparison shouldn&#x27;t be Agile vs. perfection, it should be Agile vs. what came before.\nCertifications, flawed as the model is, did spread ideas that many teams benefited from. The 2-day CSM course is shallow, but it introduced concepts that some people built on meaningfully.\nThe manifesto authors didn&#x27;t create the certification industry. Scrum predates the manifesto, and the commercial ecosystem grew around it somewhat independently.\nSome Scrum Masters and Agile coaches are genuinely good at their jobs. The criticism is about the systemic incentives, not every individual.<p>That said, I keep coming back to a structural question: when the organizations that define, certify, and sell a framework also measure its adoption, is there a realistic path to honest assessment of whether it works?\nCurious about HN&#x27;s experience. Has anyone here worked in an organization where Agile (specifically the framework, not just &quot;being adaptive&quot;) produced meaningfully better outcomes than what came before? What made it work vs. the common failure modes?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on CloudRouter, a skill + CLI that gives coding agents like Claude Code and Codex the ability to start cloud VMs and GPUs.<p>When an agent writes code, it usually needs to start a dev server, run tests, open a browser to verify its work. Today that all happens on your local machine. This works fine for a single task, but the agent is sharing your computer: your ports, RAM, screen. If you run multiple agents in parallel, it gets a bit chaotic. Docker helps with isolation, but it still uses your machine&#x27;s resources, and doesn&#x27;t give the agent a browser, a desktop, or a GPU to close the loop properly. The agent could handle all of this on its own if it had a primitive for starting VMs.<p>CloudRouter is that primitive \u2014 a skill that gives the agent its own machines. The agent can start a VM from your local project directory, upload the project files, run commands on the VM, and tear it down when it&#x27;s done. If it needs a GPU, it can request one.<p><pre><code>  cloudrouter start .&#x2F;my-project\n  cloudrouter start --gpu B200 .&#x2F;my-project\n  cloudrouter ssh cr_abc123 &quot;npm install &amp;&amp; npm run dev&quot;\n</code></pre>\nEvery VM comes with a VNC desktop, VS Code, and Jupyter Lab, all behind auth-protected URLs. When the agent is doing browser automation on the VM, you can open the VNC URL and watch it in real time. CloudRouter wraps agent-browser [1] for browser automation.<p><pre><code>  cloudrouter browser open cr_abc123 &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:3000&quot;\n  cloudrouter browser snapshot -i cr_abc123\n  # \u2192 @e1 [link] Home  @e2 [link] Settings  @e3 [button] Sign Out\n  cloudrouter browser click cr_abc123 @e2\n  cloudrouter browser screenshot cr_abc123 result.png\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s a short demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SCkkzxKBcPE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SCkkzxKBcPE</a><p>What surprised me is how this inverted my workflow. Most cloud dev tooling starts from cloud (background agents, remote SSH, etc) to local for testing. But CloudRouter keeps your agents local and pushes the agent&#x27;s work to the cloud. The agent does the same things it would do locally \u2014 running dev servers, operating browsers \u2014 but now on a VM. As I stopped watching agents work and worrying about local constraints, I started to run more tasks in parallel.<p>The GPU side is the part I&#x27;m most curious to see develop. Today if you want a coding agent to help with anything involving training or inference, there&#x27;s a manual step where you go provision a machine. With CloudRouter the agent can just spin up a GPU sandbox, run the workload, and clean it up when it&#x27;s done. Some of my friends have been using it to have agents run small experiments in parallel, but my ears are open to other use cases.<p>Would love your feedback and ideas.

      "text": "The Q1 2026 labor data presents a significant anomaly. We are observing a persistent high-volume layoff cycle (~25k YTD) occurring simultaneously with a projected $5.5T global economic loss attributed to unfilled technical roles (IDC).<p>This suggests we aren&#x27;t witnessing a cyclical downturn, but a structural &quot;displacement event&quot; driven by a rotation in capital and compute requirements.<p>Three observations for discussion:<p>1. *The Infrastructure Bottleneck:* While application-layer development is being compressed by agentic IDEs and higher-level abstractions, the demand for the &quot;underlying&quot; stack (vector orchestration, GPU cluster optimization, custom RAG pipelines) has entered a state of acute scarcity. \n2. *The Depreciation of Mid-Level Generalism:* We are seeing a &quot;Mid-Level Squeeze&quot; where companies prioritize either &quot;AI-Native&quot; entry-level talent (low cost, high adaptability) or Staff-level architects. The traditional 4-8 YOE generalist feature developer appears to be the primary demographic of the current layoff cycle.\n3. *The Revenue-to-Engineer Ratio:* For the first time, we are seeing &quot;Agentic&quot; teams of 2-3 engineers maintaining systems that previously required 15-20. This shift isn&#x27;t just about efficiency; it&#x27;s about the fundamental unit of labor changing from &quot;writing lines of code&quot; to &quot;orchestrating system logic.&quot;<p>Is the $5.5T &quot;gap&quot; actually fillable by the current workforce, or are we looking at a permanent bifurcation where a large segment of the legacy SWE population becomes structurally unemployable without a complete ground-up retraining in the data&#x2F;inference pipeline?",
